# Problem Statement:

Sales management has gained importance to meet increasing competition and the
need for improved methods of distribution to reduce cost and to increase profits. Sales
management today is the most important function in a commercial and business
enterprise.

Do ETL: Extract-Transform-Load some Amazon dataset and find for me
Sales-trend -> month-wise, year-wise, yearly_month-wise

Find key metrics and factors and show the meaningful relationships between
attributes. Do your own research and come up with your findings.

# Dataset:
You can find the dataset on the given link <br>

# Contributing
We welcome contributions from anyone interested in analyzing Amazon sales data! Whether you're a seasoned data scientist, an e-commerce enthusiast, or someone eager to learn and contribute, there are several ways you can get involved:

1. Data Analysis: Dive into our Amazon sales dataset, extract meaningful insights, and uncover trends in sales data. Analyze sales trends month-wise, year-wise, and yearly month-wise to identify patterns and fluctuations. Share your findings and suggestions for further analysis.<br>
2. ETL (Extract-Transform-Load): Help with the Extract-Transform-Load process to preprocess and clean the Amazon dataset. Ensure data quality and consistency to facilitate accurate analysis and interpretation of sales trends. Implement efficient ETL pipelines and data transformation techniques to optimize data processing.<br>
3. Visualization: Create visualizations using tools like Python, Tableau, or Power BI to represent sales trends and key metrics effectively. Visualize month-wise, year-wise, and yearly month-wise sales data to communicate insights clearly and intuitively. Your visualizations can help stakeholders understand the significance of sales trends and make informed decisions.<br>
4. Statistical Analysis: Conduct statistical analysis to identify meaningful relationships between attributes in the Amazon sales dataset. Explore correlations, trends, and dependencies between sales metrics, product categories, customer demographics, and other relevant factors. Your analysis can uncover valuable insights into factors influencing sales performance and profitability.<br>
5. Documentation: Contribute to documenting the analysis process, methodology, and findings to ensure transparency and reproducibility. Update README files, provide detailed explanations of data analysis techniques, and document key insights for reference. Clear and well-organized documentation helps users understand the analysis and replicate the results.<br>
6. Feedback and Suggestions: Provide feedback on existing analyses, suggest improvements, or propose new ideas for analysis. Share your thoughts on data processing techniques, visualization strategies, or potential areas for further exploration. Your input helps enhance the quality and relevance of our analysis and drives continuous improvement.
